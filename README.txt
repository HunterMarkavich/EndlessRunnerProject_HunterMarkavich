Ever Higher
Overview
Ever Higher is an endless runner game that challenges players to navigate through a dynamic environment filled with obstacles while collecting points to achieve the highest score possible. The player controls a character that must jump, dodge, and utilize power-ups to ascend through the game world.

Objective
The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible while collecting score collectibles and avoiding various obstacles. Players must navigate platforms and manage their movement to reach the highest score they can.

How to Play
Movement: Use the left and right arrow keys (or A/D keys) to move your character.
Jumping: Press the spacebar to jump. You can also jump off platforms to reach higher areas.
Collectibles: Gather score collectibles to increase your score.
Power-Ups
Keep an eye out for three different power-ups that can aid your gameplay:

Time Slow: This power-up temporarily slows down the gameplay, giving you extra time to navigate obstacles and collect items.
Spring Launch: Grants the player a powerful upward boost, allowing you to pass through solid platforms and gain height quickly. During this time, you will also be invincible, making it easier to avoid obstacles.
Invincibility: This power-up makes your character immune to all obstacles for a limited time, allowing you to freely move through spikes and other dangers without losing lives.
Obstacles
Avoid these three obstacles to keep your game going:

Meteor: These obstacles fall from above and can crush your character if you are not careful. Pay attention to the warning signs before they drop.
Orbital Drone: These flying drones follow a circular path and can end your game if you collide with them.
Bed of Spikes: Hidden beneath some platforms, these spikes will end your game unless you are invincible. Watch your step!
High Scores
The game tracks the top 5 high scores. Your scores are saved locally in a text file, so you can always come back and try to beat your best!

Art and Design
Ever Higher features art assets from the Unity Asset Store and original designs. Players will encounter vibrant backgrounds and unique obstacles as they progress through the game.
